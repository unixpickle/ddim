# DDIM

This repo contains some experiments with [Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=St1giarCHLP). In particular, I play with simple distributions and see how DDIM translates latents to datapoints. This is a particularly interesting class of models because the latent space is intrinsic, it's not learned, and it's really cool to investigate.
